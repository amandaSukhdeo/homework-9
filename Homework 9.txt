1. What is SQL? What are relational databases?
    SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard laguage that 
    allows you to access and manipulate databases. Relational 
    databases are a type of database that organizes data into 
    rows and columns, which collectively form a table where the 
    data points are related to one another. 

4. What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?
    PDO in PHP is a lightweight interface for accessing databases, 
    providing consistency across different database drivers. It 
    streamlines data access, requiring specific PDO drivers for 
    database interaction. Prepared statements are necessary for 
    security, guarding against SQL injection attacks by separating 
    SQL logic from user input.
